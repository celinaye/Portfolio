        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p class="lead" id="product">My group and I researched a startup and created mockups to encompass
            the main goals to the startup's concept. We chose to research the
            startup <a href="https://pyrls.com/">Pyrls</a>, a website and mobile app that enables healthcare providers
            and healthcare students to more effectively prescribe, dispense, and
            educate patients on their prescriptions.
            <br><br>
            Our iterative design focuses
            on the mobile application interface of the startup. Through our
            design, industry healthcare providers will be able to search and find
            information relating to drug prescriptions easily with this
            application through a database. Healthcare students are able to use
            the application as an educational tool to review information about
            drugs, side effects, brands, and treatment information. In the process of creating
            mockups, we used the iterative design process.
            <br><br>
            This included creating
            sketches, lo-fi mockups, and a hi-fi mockup before undergoing a design
            critique. At the design critique, we had the opportunity to meet with
            an industry professional from Figma and received valuable feedback.
            Based on this feedback, we improved our hi-fi mockups to create a
            final version of our mockups. Finally, we used a remote user testing
            service to test our mockups and analyzed the results.

        <h2>Sketches</h2>
        <p class="lead" id="product">To begin, we started with ideation and sketching a few screens. The purpose here
            was to come up with as many different ideas and designs as possible so that we could narrow down our ideas
            and focus on the best designs for the app. When sketching, we made sure to encompass various screens and
            features that we wanted to include in our app to diversify our designs.

        <h2>Design Critique</h2>
        <p class="lead" id="product">After we had our Hifi design, we then received constructive design feedback and
            critiques from our peers and the industry professional. This feedback was very helpful in improving our
            design and making the app more user friendly.
            <br><br>
            We grouped the feedback into 3 categories: Functionality, Usability, and Design. Functionality refers to the
            business side of the app. Comments here included how we could have better designed the app to target the
            business goals and needs of Pyrls. Usability refers to the ease of use of the app. Comments here included
            how we could have made the app more user friendly and intuitive. Design refers to the visual aesthetics of
            the app. Comments here included how we could have made the app more visually appealing and aesthetically
            pleasing.

        <h2>Revised Figma Prototype</h2>
        <p class="lead" id="product">Based on the feedback we received from the design critique, we decided to revise
            our high fidelity designs.
            <br><br>
            On the home page we added sections to view popular drug types and popular news. On the saved drugs page we
            color coded the types of drugs and added a search bar for findability. We also changed the home icon to a
            search icon, added back buttons to all the pages necessary for navigation purposes, and made the images of
            the drugs larger. Lastly, we increased consistency of our app by consolidating the fonts and font sizes used
            and checked that the use of pop ups and button spacing were consistent for all pages.
            <br><br>
            The new prototype can be found below.

        <p class="lead" id="product">
            Following the finalized Figma, we then conducted user testing for the
            interactive prototype. To do so, we submitted our prototype to
            <a href="usertesting.com">usertesting.com</a>, where we had to include a
            scenario and subtasks for testers to complete. The scenario and subtasks
            are as follows.

        <h3>Scenario</h3>
        <p class="lead" id="product">
            Feel free to think aloud as you complete this exercise. For this
            exercise, you will be testing an interactive mockup for a healthcare
            startup company called Pyrls. Imagine that you are using the app as a
            physician. You are looking to prescribe Ibuprofen (a type of
            anti-inflammatory drug) to a patient. However, you don't remember all
            the details about the drug. Luckily for you, you have taken notes about
            Ibuprofen on our app. Use our app to find information about Ibuprofen,
            including the notes you took on the drug.

        <h3>Analysis</h3>
        <p class="lead" id="product">
            All of the users successfully completed the four tasks they were tasked with. We tasked the users to find
            information about Ibuprofen and update their notes. The subtasks for this scenario included noting where
            users would click on the homepage, finding more information about Ibuprofen, and updating notes about
            Ibuprofen. Generally, users' actions were in line with our expectations. We expected users to find
            information about Ibuprofen through clicking the “Anti-inflamatory drug” category on the homepage or with
            the search button and clicking into the Ibuprofen page. To update their notes, we expected them to go to the
            saved drugs page through the navigation bar.
            <br><br>
            Additionally, as a final sub task, we wanted to gauge users' perspectives on different functions of the app.
            All of the users were able to identify the functions that we intended for the app to have (including finding
            drug information, seeing relevant articles, and taking notes on drugs).
            <br><br>
            Users noted the difficulty in finding the navigation bar, as at times, they were only able to access it by
            scrolling to the bottom of the page. As a result, there was some confusion about where the user was on the
            app. When creating this prototype, we didn’t expect this to happen as the navigation bar seemed to display
            properly on the Figma prototype on our laptops. So, in future mockups, we would edit the navigation bar to
            fix it relative to the bottom of the user’s screen. Finally, we noticed that each user had a different
            perspective on how simple the app should be. Thus, in future mockups, we would also review our current pages
            to ensure that all of them are necessary and contain necessary information.

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p class="lead" id="product">Through this project, we learned about the iterative process that comes with
            outlining and creating mockups. By taking user perspectives, we were able to make necessary updates to our
            mockups and improve the experience of our app. The biggest changes we made from user feedback included
            increasing user awareness of where they were in the app and creating more consistent stylistic choices. As a
            result of these changes, we were able to update our high-fidelity mockup to a final version, ready for user
            testing and to send to Pyrls for company feedback.
